## Supported Release [2.0.0]
### Summary
This major release drops puppet 3, changes dependencies from staging to archive, and adds various "real world" configuration abilities.

### Changed
- Dependency puppet-staging (which is deprecated) removed in favor of puppet-archive
- Dropped compatibility with puppet 3.x series
- Remove `true`/`false` as valid values for all ensure attributes as they are ambiguous.

### Removed
- Deprecated `tomcat::setenv::entry` attribute `base_path`. Use `config_file` instead.
- Base `tomcat` class `install_from_source` parameter now does nothing. Use `tomcat::install` attribute `install_from_source` directly instead.
- No longer testing tomcat 6 as it is EOL and removed from the mirrors.
- `tomcat::install` attribute `environment` previously used for proxy settings. Use `proxy_server` and `proxy_type` instead.

### Deprecated
- `tomcat::instance` define parameters `install_from_source`, `source_url`, `source_strip_first_dir`, `package_ensure`, `package_name`, and `package_options` have been unofficially deprecated since 1.5.0 and are now formally deprecated. Please use `tomcat::install` instead and point any `tomcat::instance::catalina_home` there. See the readme for further examples.

### Added
- Compatibility with puppet 5.x series
- Puppet 4.x data type parameter validation.
- `tomcat::config::server::realm` Can manage multiple realms of identical class names.
- `tomcat::config::server::tomcat_users` Can be declared multiple times for the same element name.
- `tomcat::config::context::value` defined type.

- `tomcat::install` attribute `allow_insecure` for disabling https verification.
- `tomcat::war` ability to use context paths and versions with `war_name` attribute.
- `tomcat::war` ability to ignore HTTPS errors with `allow_insecure` attribute.

### Fixed
- Corrected documentation for all `attributes_to_remove` attributes.

## Supported Release [1.7.0]
### Summary
This release adds support for internationalization of the module. It also contains Japanese translations for the README, summary and description of the metadata.json and major cleanups in the README. Additional folders have been introduced called locales and readmes where translation files can be found. A number of features and bug fixes are also included in this release.

### Added
- Addition of POT file for metadata translation for i18n.
- Readme update and edit in preparation for localization.
- Environment can now be passed through to staging, so we can set a proxy to download tomcat.
- Add optional `$type` parameter to globalnamingresources that allows the definition of the element to be used. Use "Environment" to set an environment.
- Allow the resource name to be overridden with a new `$resource_name` parameter.
- Added Ubuntu Xenial support to metadata.
- Bump in puppet-staging module dependancy for allowing newer versions.
- Ability to not manage catalina.properties.

- (MODULES-3224) Added mode attribute to concat resource that sets the executable bit for all permission levels.

- (FM-6166) Removing concat-fragment 'ensure'


## Supported Release 1.6.1
### Summary
This release removes an attempted bugfix made in 1.6.0 for working around strict
umasks. The previous change caused duplicate resource declarations when
downloading a tomcat tarball from `puppet://` or local paths. The umask bug
remains (it is actually present in staging, not tomcat).

### Fixed
- Fix duplicate resource declarations when using local source paths

## Supported Release 1.6.0
### Summary
This release adds two new defines for managing environment variables and manager elements, enhances multi-instance multi-user support, allows valves to be nested in contexts, fixes an issue with installing directly to NFS mounted directories, fixes installation on systems with a strict root umask,

### Added
- Add `tomcat::config::context::environment` define
- Add `tomcat::config::context::manager` define
- Add `owner` and `group` to `tomcat::config::server::tomcat_users`
- Add `parent_context` to `tomcat::config::server::valve`
- Add `manage_home` and `manage_base` to `tomcat` class
- Add `manage_home` to `tomcat::install`
- Add `manage_base` to `tomcat::instance`
- Add `doexport` (MODULES-3436), `user`, and `group` to `tomcat::setenv::entry`
- Change from `nanliu/staging` to `puppet/staging`
- Allow `role` to be set for user elements in `tomcat::config::server::tomcat_users`

### Fixed
- Fix globalresource missing (MODULES-3353)
- Fix strict vars for `tomcat::config::server::service` (MODULES-3742)
- Work around duplicate user resources (PUP-5971)

## Supported Release 1.5.0
### Summary
General rewrite of the installation and instance management code, and better
service management. Plus a handful of new configuration defined types and actual
resource dependency ordering.

The primary improvement is that you may now use `tomcat::install` for installing
various versions of tomcat into various directories (`CATALINA_HOME`), then use
`tomcat::instance` to create instances from those installs (`CATALINA_BASE`).
Previously `tomcat::instance` treated both `CATALINA_HOME` and `CATALINA_BASE` as identical and thus only allowed a single tomcat instance per tomcat installation.

Additionally, `tomcat::service` allows `use_init => true, use_jsvc => true` to
create an init script for service management of source-based installs. And
`tomcat::instance` can declare a `tomcat::service` resource for your instance to
make life easier.

### Added
- Added `tomcat::config::properties::property` define
- Added `tomcat::config::server::globalnamingresource` define
- Added `tomcat::config::context` define
- Added `tomcat::config::context::resource` define
- Added `tomcat::config::context::resourcelink` define
- Added `tomcat::install` define
- Added `tomcat::config::server::host::aliases` parameter
- Added `tomcat::service::user` parameter
- Added `tomcat::setenv::entry` parameters:
  - `catalina_home`
  - `addto`
- Added `tomcat::instance` parameters for multi-instance management:
  - `user`
  - `group`
  - `manage_user`
  - `manage_group`
  - `manage_service`
  - `java_home`
  - `use_jsvc`
  - `use_init`
- Added Debian 8 compatibility

### Fixed
- Fixed conflating `CATALINA_BASE` with `CATALINA_HOME`
- Made `tomcat::config::server::connector` protocol default to `$name`
- Lots of additional validation
- Added resource dependency declaration (so no more `<-` `->` needed)
- Undeprecated `tomcat::setenv::entry::order` parameter
